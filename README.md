# Basic Todo App

A basic todo app with darkmode made with vanilla JS. I wanted to replicate my Vue todo app without any framework.

Features:

- Create task
- Delete task
- Edit task
- Mark/unmark task as done
- Clear whole list
- Darkmode/lightmode

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run start
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```
